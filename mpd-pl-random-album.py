This script picks a random album from the MPD playlist.  Called with no
args it will pick a random album from the current playlist and start
playing.

It can also monitor MPD and select a new album in the playlist after the
last song on an album has ended. Use the -d option

Options:
   -h|--help
   -d|--daemon  : daemon.  Monitor MPD for track changes. At end of album select 
                  a new random album from the playlist
   -D|--debug   : Print debug messages to stdout
   -p|--passive : testing only. Don't make any changes to the MPD playlist
